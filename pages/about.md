## My Story

My programming journey goes back to when I was 12 years old. I wanted to make a game on Roblox and found out that roblox uses a subset of the **_lua_** programming language. I made a few simple games back then, but quickly hit a road block and gave up because I was lost and confused.

Years later I'm applying for University and I remember that satisfying feeling of making something and having other people partake in those creations. I apply as a Computer Science major, and quickly learn to love the logic, but I'm overwhelmed again. I'm learning really neat things, but theres no one to help me again, and even worse the satisfaction of having your creations in others hands is quickly erased as you realize you're mainly just making programs on the command line.

As you're down and out just trying to survive the information overload that is University, you take an introduction to Web Programming course. You take it, excited as you are finally going to make something tangible. You work with HTML, CSS, and Javasript, you grasp it in a flash! You quickly grow comfortable when you don't know how to proceed, this time being lost is a little fun and gradually you learn to love the process of learning. You soon begin making projects outside of class, you even make a Github, and people even end up contributing to your very own open source project. Finally, you're hooked, you realize that the web is your calling.
