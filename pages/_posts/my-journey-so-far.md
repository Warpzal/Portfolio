This is going to be a less wordy blog, and more of a showcase of where I came from along with links. I think you'll notice a trend of anime content haha.

### First Projects

I got into Web Development by making **_"Start pages"_**, (pages that load up when you start the browser).

Give it a refresh, I made multiple themes but this was the first project I as "proud" of.

But I made ... a lot of these pages as I was learning.

### Turning Point

I really fell in love with Web Development when I made my first opensource project, which I got help from real developers.

After that I slowly began learning all sorts of things! Node, Websockets, Frontend Frameworks.

My websites weren't very pretty, so I took my shot at reproducing sites I thought were cool just by eyeballing it, this resulted in some of my first fully responsive webpages!

### Full Stack Apps!

I used to be scared of the backend, but I quickly learned that my biggest passion is having users that use the creations I create. So I initially learned Firebase and Pocketbase until I got more comfortable with NodeJS and creating my own REST API's.

Although they may be embarassing to show off, it's always good to know where you came from. However these projects only scratch the surface of the many many web projects I've done. It would take me hours to post all of them.
If you're learning, build whatever you want, you'll get better, and you'll stay more motivated that way, instead of building to-do apps and calculators.
